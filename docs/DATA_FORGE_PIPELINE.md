# Data Forge Pipeline

*Current-state reference — Performance Property Analytics Hub. Assembled from a grounded repo audit on 2026-07-10.*

Anything the audit could not fully confirm from the repo is marked **(verify)**.

## 1. Purpose & principle

**Data Forge is the single source of truth for research data.** Every number that feeds the Online Reports, National report, Commercial report, Runway Workbook, VR Projection, Demand Score Dashboard, and Buying/Selling Slides originates in Data Forge's isolated stores and marts, then is published outward to the tools — never edited directly in the consuming tools.

**The rule (owner, 2026-07-21): any tool that needs data reads it from this pipeline. Forge updates → owner deploys (PUBLISH) → every tool's data updates.** A new data-consuming tool is wired to the `rdp_*` marts (or the isolated `forge_*` stores), never to a private feed or a hand-entered number — so there is exactly one place to refresh and one deploy step that propagates everywhere.

Three principles hold the design together:

- **Two-stage monthly cadence.** Data is *gathered* into isolated stores automatically on the 10th (plus manual collection in the UI), the owner *confirms* everything is current, then a separate manual *publish* reshapes and propagates it to the tools.
- **Isolation by design.** The `rdp_*` / `forge_*` schema was deliberately kept isolated from the live tools (migration 050 header: "nothing in the live site reads it yet… ZERO risk"). Cutover is deliberate and staged — see §7 for what has actually flipped.
- **Preserve history / upsert-only.** No ingest ever deletes rows the source no longer covers. Widest-window upserts everywhere.

## 2. The monthly cadence at a glance

```
   10th of month (~1am AEST)                Owner, in Data Forge UI            Manual, from Actions tab
  ┌───────────────────────────┐          ┌───────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────────┐
  │  STAGE 1 — GATHER          │          │  CONFIRM                │        │  STAGE 2 — PUBLISH         │
  │  forge-ingests.yml (cron)  │  ──────► │  Freshness banner:      │ ─────► │  forge-publish.yml         │
  │  21 API ingests +          │          │  every point green or   │        │  (workflow_dispatch only)  │
  │  1 local JSA run           │          │  "✓ No new data" checked│        │  11 steps, strict order    │
  └───────────────────────────┘          └───────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────────┘
            │                                                                          │
            ▼                                                                          ▼
   forge_* stores + rdp_raw_series                                    rdp_* marts + report_data_cache
   (isolated; tools do NOT see this yet)                              (this is what the tools read)
```

**Key point: "auto-updated on the 10th" does NOT mean the tools changed.** GATHER only lands data in the isolated stores. Nothing reaches a tool until the owner manually runs PUBLISH.

---

## 3. Stage 1 — GATHER

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/forge-ingests.yml` — *"Data Forge — 1/ GATHER (API ingests)"*.

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Trigger | cron `0 15 9 * *` = 15:00 UTC on the 9th = **~1:00 AM AEST on the 10th** (drifts to ~2:00 AM during AEDT, Oct–Apr). Also `workflow_dispatch`. |
| Runner | `ubuntu-latest`, Node 22, `npm install`, Puppeteer download skipped, 45-min timeout, `concurrency: forge-ingests`, `cancel-in-progress: false`. |
| Secrets | `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` only (server-side write). No FRED/IMF/ABS keys — all keyless public endpoints. |
| Resilience | each ingest runs under `set +e`; one failure doesn't stop the rest. Failures record `status='error'` into `forge_data_status` (red flag in UI). The job exits 1 at the end if any ingest errored. |

Scope: this workflow **only gathers** into the isolated research DB. It does **not** rebuild the report mart — that is the separate, manual "2/ PUBLISH" workflow.

### 3a. The 21 auto-run API ingests (exact YAML order)

All write **`rdp_raw_series`** (long format, upsert `onConflict: source,region_slug,metric,freq,period`) unless a `forge_*` JSONB store is named. Each also appends an `rdp_runs` log row and upserts `forge_data_status`.

| 18 | ingest-national-only | ABS CWD + IMF DataMapper + RBA + cash_rate read-back + seeds | — | — | **forge_national_only** |
| 19 | ingest-abs-act-industry | ABS 5220.0 Table 9 (ACT GVA by industry) | — | — | **forge_industry** (Canberra only; keeps REMPLAN regions) |

| 23 | ingest-abs-patient-experiences | ABS 4839.0 Patient Experiences — data cube "Tables 1 to 3" (.xlsx linked from the release page; annual, ~November) | `gp_share` (by FY, period = FY start 1 July) + `gp_share_<band>` (8 age bands, latest release) | A | rdp_raw_series (region australia) + forge_data_status `gp_access` → feeds the two Commercial GP tabs at PUBLISH |
| 24 | ingest-budget-health-expenses | Department of Finance Budget tables on data.gov.au ("Budget YYYY-YY and PBS - Tables and Data" → Budget Paper No.1 Tables zip → "Estimates of expenses by function", Health row; annual, May) | `fed_health_expenses` ($m by FY, period = FY start; each year = its newest Budget estimate) | A | rdp_raw_series (source `budget`) + forge_data_status `fed_health_budget` → feeds the Commercial health-budget tab at PUBLISH |
| 25 | ingest-abs-building-price-index | ABS PPI (dataflow `PPI`, T18 house construction inputs) over the ABS Data API — six state capitals + weighted average; Canberra/Darwin history from the Rawlinsons handbook CSV when present locally | `building_price_index` | Q & A (FY-to-June) | rdp_raw_series (sources `abs`, `rawlinsons`) + forge_data_status `building_price_index` — **in the GATHER loop since 2026-09-12; before that it was run by hand** |
| 26 | ingest-rawlinsons-bpi | Rawlinsons Market Insight — the FREE quarterly PDF on rawlhouse.com.au (Apr-2026 edition on carries "Rawlinsons Building Price Index", eight capitals; forecasts skipped) | `building_price_index` (Q, 8 capitals; A = calendar-year mean for Canberra/Darwin) | Q & A | rdp_raw_series (source `rawlinsons`) + forge_data_status `rawlinsons_bpi` → the Commercial building-price tab's Canberra/Darwin columns |

### 3b. The local-run sources

Two API points are fetched from the laptop rather than CI, because the source
breaks or blocks **for the GitHub runners specifically**. Both are driven by the
one launcher, `scripts/run-jsa-jobcreation.cmd`.

- **`ingest-jsa-jobcreation.mjs`** — JSA Internet Vacancy Index (`.xlsx`). Metrics `job_creation_index` (36 cities) + `internet_vacancies`, source=`jsa`, freq M → `rdp_raw_series` (upsert-only + `rdp_runs` + `forge_data_status`).
- **Not in CI:** jobsandskills.gov.au hard-blocks GitHub runner IPs at the network layer (a gov WAF — connection refused, not a UA filter; a browser UA + retry both failed).
- **`ingest-oecd-consumer-confidence.mjs`** — OECD CCI for Australia, monthly, amplitude adjusted. Moved out of CI on **2026-09-10**.
- **Not in CI:** `sdmx.oecd.org` returns HTTP 500 `languageTag1` to the GitHub runners while the *identical* request from Australia returns 200. Proven on 2026-09-09 across two runs minutes apart — 4 JSON retries plus the CSV fallback failed in CI both times, while 10 consecutive local attempts all succeeded. It had already reddened the 2026-08 GATHER the same way. The script's three resilience layers (retries → CSV → skip-if-fresh) cannot help, because the skip only applies while the series is fresh and the hard failure is precisely the case where it is not. Leaving it in CI turned a healthy pipeline red every month, which is how a real alert gets ignored.
- **How they run:** each month from a non-blocked machine (the laptop): `node scripts/ingest-jsa-jobcreation.mjs --write` and `node scripts/ingest-oecd-consumer-confidence.mjs --write`.
- **The scheduled task exists.** The launcher `scripts/run-jsa-jobcreation.cmd` is committed, and the Windows task *"Performance Forge - JSA Job Creation (monthly)"* is registered and Ready on the laptop (10th, noon). If the registration is ever lost, `scripts/register-jsa-task.ps1` re-creates it.

### 3c. Upsert / history rules

- Every `rdp_raw_series` write is upsert-only on the 5-column key — never deletes rows the API dropped.
- JSONB stores read-then-merge: pop-pyramid keeps manual regionals; act-industry only touches `canberra`; remplan-industry only touches its 35 regions; demand_inputs keeps manual REA listings; national_only / commercial pin/merge against seeds.
- SQM ingests refuse to write when nothing parsed ("Nothing parsed — refusing to write") to avoid wiping good data with an empty scrape.

### 3d. Explicitly out of GATHER scope (manual)

> **Sentiment, split 2026-09-12.** The Westpac–MI **House Price Expectations Index (national, monthly)** is now
> gathered automatically by `ingest-westpac-hpei.mjs` from the public bulletin PDF (its own Forge card,
> `hpei_national`). The bulletin has **no state table**, so the **VIC** index that B/S page 31 charts, and
> **NAB Business Confidence** (numbers only in charts; the data is a NAB subscriber product), stay on the
> manual Sentiment card / the CSV export.

Cotality, Mortgage Arrears (S&P SPIN), Industry REMPLAN uploads, and the REA listings in the Demand card. (`ingest-data-dump.mjs` / `ingest-deferred.mjs` exist but are one-off historical seeders — not referenced by the workflow and not scheduled.)

---

## 4. Manual collection (in the Data Forge UI, `tools/data-forge.html`)

Editing is gated by `_forgeCanEdit` (dev/admin tier; **defaults to DENY** until tier resolves). This is UI feedback only — real writes are RLS-gated server-side by `is_writer()`.

| Data point | Store | How the owner updates it |
|---|---|---|
| **Cotality** (the main monthly drop) | `forge_cotality` (`latest` + `rentvacancy`) | COTALITY view: drop the Market Trends `.xlsx` + two Vacancy/Rent `.csv`. Parsed in-browser, filtered to capitals + 28 LGAs (matched/missing QC pill), upserts. The `.xlsx` also appends `forge_monthly_price` and recomputes CIV. Each drop replaces `latest`/`rentvacancy`. |
| **Mortgage Arrears** | `forge_arrears` | ARR view: drop the S&P SPIN `.xlsx`; parser maps National + state columns, normalises to %, upserts (replaces the series). |
| **Industry (Value Added)** | `forge_industry` | IND view: pick region → open its REMPLAN link → grab "Value added by industry" → drop file. Each drop **merges** regions into the store. Canberra is auto (ABS); never uploaded. |
| **Commercial** | `forge_commercial` (17 tabs) | COMMERCIAL view **in-place editor**: pick tab → ✏️ Edit → add/delete rows, edit cells → Save writes the whole jsonb straight to the store. No spreadsheet, no re-seed. Editing a ⚡ wired tab is allowed but a banner warns it's overwritten on the 10th by PUBLISH. |
| **Demand listings (REA)** | `forge_demand_inputs` | DEMANDINPUTS → Listings tab: type House/Unit counts or use the one-click **"REA → Forge" bookmarklet**. Save merges only changed fields (re-fetches the store first to avoid stale-tab clobber). Rent house/unit + VR tabs are **read-only** — refreshed only by the SQM scripts. |
| **National Only (3 seeded series)** | `forge_national_only` | NATONLY view is read-only. The 3 manual series (federalBudget, govtDebtGdp, householdComposition) are updated by editing the lists in `scripts/ingest-national-only.mjs` then running `node … --write`. No in-tool write path. |

### Freshness indicators

`freshInfo()` classifies each card: **current ≤40d (green) / aging ≤75d (amber) / stale >75d (red)**.
- Manual points (cotality, arrears, industry, commercial, demand_inputs) take their date from the **store row's `updated_at`**.
- civ / monthly_price / computed_metrics show a neutral "live" chip. commodity_prices shows "static" unless checked.
- Everything else uses `forge_data_status.last_ok_at` / `updated_at`.

### The "✓ No new data" check (migration 076)

Each non-derived, non-errored card has a check button → `markNoNewData` upserts `forge_data_status {checked_at:now, checked_by:email}`. `freshInfo` uses the **more recent of data-refresh vs check** as effective age, so a checked card shows "checked · Nd" and turns green **without any data changing**. A check now **expires after 40 days** — it cannot keep a card green indefinitely; once expired the card ages from its real data date again until re-checked or refreshed.

---

## 5. The confirmation step

At the top of Data Forge home, a **freshness banner** names any Stale/Aging points ("**Stale:** … **Aging:** … — refresh these before relying on the reports.") or shows green "✓ All data points current — every source refreshed within ~40 days." The banner also **names any stale-fallback regions** (regions a store lacks, so `enrich-marts` served them from old `rdp_raw_series` copies), and **pipeline health is visible in the tool** — last GATHER, last PUBLISH, and the monthly watchdog's verdict (from `forge_data_status` rows `pipeline_gather` / `pipeline_publish`).

Cards are grouped by gathering method (Manual / Local / Hybrid / Auto / Derived / Static), each with an ingest chip (⚡ Auto / 📄 Seeded / ✋ Manual / 🖥️ Local / 🔀 Hybrid / 🔗 Derived) and a freshness chip. Manual/local/hybrid groups are the ones needing human action.

The owner's job before publishing: get every point either **freshly refreshed** or **"✓ No new data" checked** so the banner reads all-current. **There is no PUBLISH button in the tool** — publish is an external GitHub workflow; the tool's role is only to signal readiness.

---

## 6. Stage 2 — PUBLISH

**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/forge-publish.yml` — **`workflow_dispatch` only** (manual from the Actions tab). No cron. Single `set -e` bash step (any non-zero exit aborts the rest), 30-min timeout, `concurrency: forge-publish` / `cancel-in-progress: false`, no Chromium. It fetches no external data — only reshapes what's already in Forge, so it's safe to re-run.

The run's outcome is recorded to `forge_data_status` as **`pipeline_publish`** (GATHER records **`pipeline_gather`**), and a monthly watchdog — `.github/workflows/forge-watchdog.yml`, on the 14th — red-flags a missed GATHER or PUBLISH month.

### The ordered DAG (read → write)

| # | Script | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **publish-readiness-gate** | `forge_data_status`, the `forge_*` stores | nothing — **INPUT gate**; fails the run before any mart write if the inputs aren't ready |
| 2 | **sync-cotality-medians-to-rdp** | `forge_cotality` (`latest` + `rentvacancy`), `rdp_regions` | `rdp_raw_series` — the FULL drop's current-year annual rows: mp_h/mp_u, sales_h/u, adom_h/u (corelogic) + som_h/u, vacancy_rate (÷100), rent_h/u (sqm). Prior years untouched |
| 3 | **sync-arrears** | `forge_arrears`, `rdp_raw_series` (existing series, for the parity diff) | `rdp_raw_series` metric `arrears` (values ÷100 to fractions, hardcoded st-*→capital slug map) — closes the National-vs-regional arrears divergence |
| 4 | **build-report-feed** | `rdp_raw_series` (A), `rdp_regions` | `rdp_report_feed` city rows — `payload:{years}` (**extras-PRESERVING**; year ceiling is dynamic, no hardcoded 2026) |
| 5 | **build-national-report** | `rdp_raw_series` (A), `rdp_regions` | `rdp_report_feed` `australia` row — `payload:{national:true,years}` (extras-preserving, same) |
| 6 | **enrich-marts** | `rdp_report_feed`, `rdp_raw_series`, `forge_cotality`/`forge_monthly_price`/`forge_industry`/`forge_population_pyramid` | `rdp_report_feed` — `{...payload, extras}` (pyramid, industry, arrears, jci, CIV yields, lending, national + Perth extras); writes `extras._sources` provenance and **names any stale-fallback regions** |
| 7 | **rebuild-vr-forecast-from-forge** | `rdp_vr_forecast`, `rdp_raw_series` (population, approvals_h/u), `forge_demand_inputs` | `rdp_vr_forecast` |
| 8 | **build-runway** | `rdp_runway_config`, `rdp_report_feed` | `rdp_runway` |
| 9 | **build-commercial-from-rdp** | `forge_commercial`, `rdp_raw_series` | `forge_commercial` (the 12 Forge-wired tabs only — incl. building price indices, cash rate v inflation, population pyramid [latest ERP year v 20 earlier], the two GP tabs and the federal health budget since 2026-09-12; manual tabs passed through; the six dead tabs stripped; **fails the run on >25% divergence** instead of just warning) |
| 10 | **refresh-snapshots-from-forge** | `rdp_report_feed`, `rdp_raw_series`, `forge_national_only`/`forge_arrears`/`forge_population_pyramid`/`forge_cotality`/`forge_commercial` | `report_data_cache` (one row per cluster: capital/qld/nsw/vicwatas/national/commercial); logs `rdp_runs` |
| 11 | **post-publish-verify** | `rdp_report_feed`/`rdp_vr_forecast`/`rdp_runway`, `forge_cotality` + `forge_arrears`, `report_data_cache` | nothing — **OUTPUT gate**; fails the run if the marts didn't absorb the stores, arrears/median parity breaks (month-aligned), or snapshots are stale |

### Ordering gotchas (all confirmed correct in the YAML)

- **sync-cotality (2) before build-report-feed (4):** writes current-year medians into `rdp_raw_series` so the feed's annual read picks them up. If `forge_cotality` `latest` is empty/missing `.data.cap`, this step hard-exits → with `set -e` it **aborts the whole publish** (a month with no Cotality drop blocks the entire mart rebuild).
- **build-report-feed (4) / build-national (5) before enrich-marts (6):** steps 4–5 are now **extras-preserving** — they merge `{years}` into the existing payload instead of replacing it, so a crash before enrich (6) no longer strips `payload.extras` from the mart. enrich (6) still re-writes `{...payload, extras}` fresh from the stores, so it must follow both.
- **rebuild-vr (7) before build-runway (8)**; **build-commercial (9) before refresh-snapshots (10)** (which reads `forge_commercial`).

## 7. Consumers

| Tool | Forge table(s) read | Default / opt-in / live | Fallback chain | Cutover status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Online Reports** | `rdp_report_feed` | **Forge default** (`?src=live`/`legacy` forces old feed) | Forge → localStorage 15-min cache → `report_data_cache` snapshot → Apps Script | DONE (default) |
| **Commercial report** | `forge_commercial` | **Forge default** | Forge → snapshot → Apps Script | DONE (default) |
| **National report** | `forge_national_only` + `rdp_raw_series` + `rdp_report_feed` + `forge_arrears`/`forge_population_pyramid`/`forge_cotality` | **Forge default** (Forge used only if it returns a non-empty `data.year`) | Forge assemble → snapshot → Apps Script | DONE (default) |
| **Runway Workbook** | `rdp_runway`, `rdp_runway_config`, `rdp_regions`, `rdp_raw_series` | Forge-native only (no toggle) | none | Native from start |
| **VR Projection** | `rdp_vr_forecast` (+ `rdp_regions`, `forge_demand_inputs` for freshness) | Forge-native only (no toggle) | none | Native from start |
| **Demand Score Dashboard** | `forge_demand_inputs` + `rdp_vr_forecast` + `rdp_runway` + `forge_monthly_price` + `rdp_raw_series` + `forge_cotality` + `rdp_runway_config`; score computed **client-side** (no `rdp_demand_score` read) | Forge-native only (no toggle) | none; versioned `forge_demand_snapshots` for compare | Native, but off the central mart path (manual seed lineage) |
| **Runway v Demand** (`runway-demand.html`) | `forge_demand_snapshots` (`rvd-*` push mirrors) merged over the hardcoded `RAW` baseline; localStorage = same-month manual override | Forge-native merge (no toggle) | localStorage → baseline `RAW` | **Ported 2026-07-10** — the Demand Score "Push" now mirrors to Forge, so every machine/deck sees pushed months; Manage→Delete removes the Forge copy too |
| **Buying/Selling Slides** (`buying-selling-slides.html`, Vault) | `rdp_raw_series` (At-a-Glance headline stats + the median/yield/P2I/population/finance chart slides), `rdp_report_feed` (via `getFeed`), `rdp_runway` + `rdp_vr_forecast` (Traffic-Lights + VR-projection slides, via the shared engines), `forge_demand_snapshots` (the embedded Runway v Demand slide), `clock_state` (direction/type) | Forge-native only (no toggle) | none — reads the marts live on each deck load (in-session per-region cache only) | **Native from start** (added 2026-07). The deck is as fresh as the last PUBLISH: property medians/rent/vacancy/DOM/yield reach `rdp_raw_series` only via PUBLISH step 2 (`sync-cotality-medians-to-rdp`); the runway/VR/feed slides read PUBLISH-computed marts. Only the per-deck header chrome (title/disclaimer/rule/logo overlays) lives in `reports_state` — never data. |

Notes:
- The Forge path on Online Reports **bypasses the snapshot/cache** — every page load hits `rdp_report_feed` live; the cache/snapshot only engage on a Forge failure (via `liveDataFetch`).
- Header comments in commercial/national claiming the adapter was "used only with `?src=forge`" were stale — **fixed 2026-07-10**; comments now match the Forge-default behaviour.
- **Demand Score lineage:** the live score is computed **client-side** by `PP_DEMAND_ENGINE` in `tools/demand-score.html` from the tables above (forge_demand_inputs + rdp_vr_forecast + rdp_runway + forge_cotality + forge_monthly_price + rdp population). The `rdp_demand_score` mart is **retired** (decision 2026-07-10) — it was a write-only dead end with zero readers; `scripts/build-demand-score.mjs` is kept for reference only.

---

## 8. Storage & security model

Two families, both in `public`, both deliberately isolated from the live site until cutover.

### Tier A — `forge_*` single-row JSONB stores (manual/UI + JSONB ingest land here)

Shape: `id text PK default 'latest'`, `data jsonb`, `uploaded_at`, `uploaded_by`, `updated_at`.
`forge_cotality` (054 — filtered columns only; the raw licensed CoreLogic workbook is NOT stored), `forge_industry` (055), `forge_population_pyramid` (056, hybrid API+upload), `forge_arrears` (057), `forge_national_only` (058), `forge_monthly_price` (059), `forge_commercial` (060), `forge_demand_inputs` (064), `forge_demand_snapshots` (065 — the one versioned store, PK `version`; also carries the `rvd-*` Runway-v-Demand push mirrors), `forge_data_status` (053 + `checked_at`/`checked_by` in 076 + the full data-key seed in 077).

### Tier B — `rdp_*` research marts (PUBLISH computes into here)

- **L0** `rdp_sources` (registry, `last_ingested_at`). **L1** `rdp_regions` (PK `slug`, +`aliases` jsonb; 051 adds 8 state rows), `rdp_metrics` (controlled vocab; 051 adds vacancy_rate_h/u, commenced_h/u, underemployment).
- **L1 raw** `rdp_raw_series` — long format, **PK (source, region_slug, metric, freq, period)**, `value numeric`. Source is in the PK so overlapping feeds coexist and marts pick the authoritative one. Secondary indexes (metric,period) and (region_slug,metric). **No FK** to regions/metrics — a typo'd slug/metric ingests silently; marts must validate.
- **L2 marts** (uniform `region_slug` PK, `payload jsonb`, `source_month`, `computed_at`, `computed_by`): `rdp_report_feed` (+`cluster`, indexed), `rdp_vr_forecast`, `rdp_runway`, `rdp_demand_score`, `rdp_civ`. Plus cluster-compat views (`rdp_report_feed_capital/_qld/_nsw/_vicwatas`, `security_invoker=on`) and `rdp_runway_config` (052).
- **Lineage:** `rdp_runs` — append-only run log (id, dataset, source_month, row_count, status, run_by, run_at). Distinct from the per-point `forge_data_status` current-state health row.

### RLS

Uniform across both tiers: **authenticated read (`using(true)`), writer-only write (`is_writer()` = dev/admin)**. `rdp_*` uses four per-command policies each; `forge_*` uses one `FOR ALL` policy — functionally equivalent. The browser holds only the anon key; the service-role key lives only in GitHub secrets. `is_writer()` itself (defined in 001_init) was not re-verified this pass. **(verify)**

**Applied-vs-pending state is not discoverable from the SQL** — there is no tracking table or marker in-repo; migrations are applied by hand via the dashboard SQL editor on the owner's schedule. Memory marks the Forge data points SHIPPED, which implies 050–065/076 are live, but that is inference, not a direct signal. **(verify)**

## 9. Known gaps & fragilities

**Store → mart stranding**
- ~~`forge_arrears` stranded for the 35 regional/capital reports~~ **Fixed:** `sync-arrears` (PUBLISH step 3) copies `forge_arrears` into `rdp_raw_series` metric `arrears` before `enrich-marts` runs, so a fresh S&P SPIN drop now reaches National and the regional/capital reports alike.
- Industry, population_pyramid, monthly_price, and the commercial API tabs are wired correctly (preferred-store pattern). `enrich-marts` still falls back to **stale** `rdp_raw_series ind_/pyr_` copies when a store lacks a region (e.g. Perth Mining 30.86% old vs 65.8% current REMPLAN) — but the fallback is now **surfaced**: `enrich-marts` writes `extras._sources` provenance and names the stale-fallback regions, and the Data Forge freshness banner names them too.

**Process / handoff**
- **PUBLISH is still 100% manual**, but a forgotten month is no longer silent: the monthly watchdog (`forge-watchdog.yml`, 14th) red-flags a missed GATHER or PUBLISH month, and pipeline health (GATHER / PUBLISH / watchdog) is visible in the Data Forge tool.
- ~~No pre-PUBLISH parity/readiness gate~~ **Fixed:** `publish-readiness-gate` (step 1, INPUT gate) fails the run before any mart write, and `post-publish-verify` (step 11, OUTPUT gate) fails it after — checking the marts absorbed the stores, arrears/median parity, and snapshot freshness. `build-commercial-from-rdp` now fails the run on >25% divergence instead of only warning.
- ~~"✓ No new data" can mask genuinely stale data indefinitely~~ **Fixed:** a check now expires after 40 days, so repeated real checks are required to keep a card green.
- **JSA remains laptop-bound**, but it is now driven by the registered Windows scheduled task (§3b) rather than a remembered manual command; `scripts/register-jsa-task.ps1` restores the registration if it's ever lost.

**Infra fragility**
- GitHub cron is best-effort (dropped runs already bit scorecards) and UTC cron drifts ~1h across AEST/AEDT; GATHER still has **no catch-up window**, but the watchdog (14th) now red-flags a missed month instead of it passing silently.
- Fragile non-API sources: `ingest-abs-retail` downloads the MHSI Table 19 `.xlsx` (RT SDMX flow frozen); SQM rents/vacancy are HTML scrapes with a spoofed UA — markup or UA changes break them (they do flag `status='error'` and refuse empty writes).
- ~~Two writers to `report_data_cache`~~ **Fixed:** all three "Save data" buttons are Forge-sourced, `PPReportCache.updateAllSnapshots` is neutralized dead code, and `refresh-report-cache.yml` is deprecated behind a typed confirm — a "Save data" click can no longer clobber the Forge snapshot.
- **PDF renderer `&fresh=1` is a documented no-op** on the Forge-default path (the render-reports comment was rewritten 2026-07-10 to state this is intended). Residual risk only: PDFs are exactly as fresh as the last PUBLISH — the watchdog's publish-pending check covers the lag.
- **Local-machine-only dependency.** `ingest-deferred` (arrears/JCI/pyramid/industry/mining/iron/lending) and `build-national-report`'s verify read `~/Downloads/*.xlsx`; JSA is local-only (scheduled task, §3b); `build-demand-score` is retired (see below). A real slice of the "source of truth" still depends on one person's machine, unreproducible in CI.

**Data-model risks**
- `forge_*` stores are single `latest` rows with **no history** (except `forge_demand_snapshots`) — a bad merge/upload overwrites the prior payload with no DB-level rollback; the only audit trail is `uploaded_by`/`uploaded_at` on the surviving row.
- ~~Hardcoded provenance stamps and the 2026 year ceiling~~ **Fixed:** `build-report-feed`'s year ceiling is dynamic (no 2027 cliff) and provenance stamps reflect the run month; `enrich-marts` writes `extras._sources` provenance.
- **Demand Score lineage settled (2026-07-10):** the live score computes **client-side** (`PP_DEMAND_ENGINE` in `tools/demand-score.html`) from `forge_demand_inputs` + `rdp_vr_forecast` + `rdp_runway` + `forge_cotality` + `forge_monthly_price` + rdp population. `rdp_demand_score` is **retired** — it was a write-only dead end (builder in no workflow, wrote `score:null`/`listings:null`, zero readers); `build-demand-score.mjs` carries a RETIRED header and is kept for reference only.
- **`runway-demand.html` — Forge port done 2026-07-10.** Pushed months now mirror to `forge_demand_snapshots` (`rvd-YYYY-MM`) and merge on every machine; the historical Jan-2025→May-2026 baseline stays a frozen in-file literal (it is history, not live data); localStorage remains the same-month manual override.
- **Status seeding — closed by migration 077 (pending apply, like 076).** 077 seeds a row for every data_key (ingest-written + pipeline_* heartbeats + manual points, `updated_at` pinned to epoch so never-run points read stale, not "current"), and deletes the orphan `internet_vacancies` error key. Until 077 is applied, points that have never run simply lack a row (their first real run creates it).
