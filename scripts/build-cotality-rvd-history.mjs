// build-cotality-rvd-history.mjs — build Runway v Demand's COTALITY timeline
// (the V2 basis) from Cotality's own monthly exports.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The V2 switch added 2026-09-15 lets the Demand Score be built on Cotality
// vacancy and rent instead of SQM's, but Runway v Demand can only show months
// somebody has pushed on that basis. This builds them.
//
// WHERE EACH INPUT COMES FROM, AND WHY
// ------------------------------------
//   vacancy + rent   the "VR and Rent" workbooks Van exports from Cotality —
//                    one Historic file covering 1982-01 .. 2026-01 and one file
//                    per month after it, in Capital Cities and LGA pairs.
//                    Columns: State, (Capital City|Council Name), Property
//                    Type, Month end, Vacancy Rate (1 month), Median Asking
//                    Rent (3 months). Eight capitals + 28 regional councils =
//                    the 36 markets.
//   rent 3 years ago the SAME series, 36 months earlier. Worth saying out loud:
//                    an earlier cut took this from the ANNUAL series because no
//                    monthly history was known to exist. It does, and a rent
//                    growth built from one monthly series beats one spliced
//                    across two.
//   days on market   forge_cl_suburbs, a monthly Cotality archive: 96 months,
//                    2018-07 .. 2026-06, capital / lga / suburb, 30 metrics.
//                    Read at the DATA month, which is the same vintage the SQM
//                    line had at that label — its days on market were always
//                    Cotality's too.
//   listings         the LABEL month's stored Demand Score snapshot, which is
//                    the REA series — the same listings the SQM line uses.
//                    ⚠ NOT Cotality's `listings1`. An earlier cut took that and
//                    it is a different measure on a different scale (Brisbane
//                    2026-05: REA 2,709 against Cotality's 9,032), so it moved
//                    a number this exercise is not supposed to touch. Only
//                    vacancy and rent change between the two bases.
//   population       the LABEL month's snapshot.
//   runway           the same snapshot. Runway is basis-independent — it is
//                    price against borrowing power and has nothing to do with
//                    which vacancy series is in play — so the Cotality series
//                    and the SQM one share it by design, and the only thing
//                    that moves between the two charts is the demand axis.
//
// THE MONTHS ARE LABELLED THE WAY THE SQM TIMELINE LABELS ITS OWN (Van, 2026-09-15)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A month on this chart is the month the reading was AVAILABLE, not the month
// the data covers — because that is what the SQM line already does, and two
// series on one timeline have to mean the same thing by "August". SQM's
// "Aug 2026" was captured on 2026-08-11 and the Cotality-sourced figures inside
// it are May 2026, so the offset is three months.
//
// MEASURED, not assumed. `forge_cl_suburbs.uploaded_at` dates each Cotality
// month's arrival, and the three months that were loaded as they came in are
// exactly three months behind their own data: 2026-04 landed 2026-07-19,
// 2026-05 landed 2026-08-10, 2026-06 landed 2026-09-12. (Everything from
// 2026-03 back shows a longer lag only because it was bulk-loaded in one go on
// 2026-07-22, so those dates say nothing about the cadence.)
//
// So: LABEL = data month + 3. Cotality's June is this chart's September;
// this chart's January 2025 is Cotality's October 2024.
//
// Worth knowing if this is ever revisited: Van's own workbook, "Data Base.xlsx",
// was labelled the OTHER way — by the month the data covers. Checked across four
// capitals and all fourteen of its months, every vacancy figure matched its
// same-named month end exactly, to four decimal places. The workbook is
// superseded by these exports and no longer read.
//
// WHAT LIMITS THE RANGE
// ---------------------
// Not the vacancy data, which runs from 1982. The runway does: stored Demand
// Score snapshots begin 2025-01, which is this chart's floor. At the new end,
// Cotality's newest published month is 2026-06, which under the rule above is
// September 2026 — so October onward does not exist yet.

/* Van, 2026-09-15: run the projection on the Cotality vacancy rather than feed
   the engine a raw observation, so V2 differs from V1 in exactly one thing —
   the SOURCE — and nothing else.

   The projection (shared/vr-forecast-calc.js) touches the current vacancy in
   one place only:
       households = population / hhSize
       properties = households / (1 - currentVR)
       forecastVR = (properties + supply - households - newHouseholds)

   and only `currentVR` swapped. Those inputs — population, household size,
   expected people, supply — are annual and move slowly, and they are identical
   for both bases, so holding them still is what isolates the source.
   Sanity: the derivative with respect to vacancy is almost exactly 1 (Perth
   0.64→1.02 gives 0.55→0.92), which is why the additive re-base an earlier cut
   used landed so close to the real thing.

/* WHERE THIS GOES, and why it is not forge_demand_snapshots.
 *
 * It used to be written there, one 'rvdcot-YYYY-MM' row per month. The Demand
 * Score Dashboard builds its month list from that table and excludes only
 * 'rvd-%' -- which 'rvdcot-' does not match, the fourth character being a 'c' --
 * so all 21 rows arrived in its compare view carrying THIS payload shape
 * instead of a capture's: market names rendered as array indices and runway
 * read 2614% where the market was on 26.14% (2026-09-16, on production).
 *
 * A deny-list on a table two tools share is the wrong shape. So the timeline is
 * ONE row in forge_cotality, whose eight readers all query `.eq('id', ...)` and
 * therefore cannot see a new id. Rewriting the whole row each run also makes
 * "stale months" impossible: what is not in this build is not in the store.
